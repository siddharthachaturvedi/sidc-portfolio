## 👤 About

### 🌍 Previous Chapter: **Planetary Scale**
**Director of Product Management**

Directed the intersection of AI and Global Security. From tracking pathogens with **Premonition** to deploying Gen AI systems - from LLMs to Agents - for the **US Federal Government (Civilian)**. 300+ use cases.

### 🎯 Current Focus: **Precision Truth**
**Under-represented Disease Research**

Decoupling intelligence from human bottlenecks. Solving data swamps in scientific research, starting with the underserved landscape of **Endometriosis**. Evidence-grade. Autonomous.

## 🧮 The Value Function

**Resonance + Relevance + Response**

> *Alignment is a three-body problem. Truth without voice feels robotic. Voice without truth hallucinates. Both without utility waste compute.*

| Component | Definition | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Resonance** | Anchors the model in organizational voice and brand aesthetics to prevent generic, robotic outputs | A healthcare AI that speaks with clinical precision while maintaining patient-centered warmth |
| **Relevance** | Grounds responses in proprietary knowledge and verified data sources to eliminate hallucination | Research synthesis that cites only peer-reviewed sources from your institutional database |
| **Response** | Ensures outputs are actionable, deterministic, and directly useful to the end user's workflow | Generating structured clinical protocols, not just answering questions about treatment options |
