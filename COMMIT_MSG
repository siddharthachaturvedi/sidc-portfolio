## Summary

- Add a minimal sidc.ai demo portfolio page for the Rovo Confluence → GitHub → Jira flow.
- Implement sections for Ventures, Investigations, Advisory, Availability, and Connect.
- Wire a simple, static HTML page as the current implementation surface.

## Source of truth

The latest, canonical description of ventures, investigations, advisory, and availability
is maintained in Confluence:

https://sidc.atlassian.net/wiki/x/AAH5

## Notes

This implementation is an initial pass and may not yet fully align with the Confluence PRD
(e.g., venture coverage, naming, and narrative emphasis).
A follow-up audit can reconcile any discrepancies between the site and the Confluence page.
